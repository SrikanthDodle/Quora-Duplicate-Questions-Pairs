# Quora-Duplicate-Questions-Pairs
Quora is a platform for general-purpose Q&A platform.

One of the many problems that quora face is the duplication of questions. Duplication of question ruins the experience for both the questioner and the answerer. Since the questioner is asking a duplicate question, we can just show him/her the answers to the previous question. And the answerer doesn't have to repeat his/her answer for essentially the same questions.

For example, we have a question like "How can I be a good geologist?" and there are some answers to that question. Later someone else asks another question like "What should I do to be a great geologist?". We can see that both the questions are asking the same thing. Even though the wordings for the question are different, the intention of both questions is same. So the answers will be same for both questions. This problem is available on Kaggle as a competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs
